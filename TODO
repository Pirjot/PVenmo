TODO List for PVenmo:

Overall Goal: Seamlessly simulate the reverse engineered version of Venmo on a Phone

First Part: Setup GET/POST Methods on Django
Figure out how to allow the frontend to make requests to the actual server
(Must be on the same port so just add as a separate route)

Second Part: Add Google Sign In Capability on the frontend
Add a single button to be able to sign into Google (have to register the app to do
so in Google Cloud as usual and store the user's email as their identity)

2-3 Part: Update File structure
W

Third Part: Using server side database (possibly in already setup sqlite if not
then maybe MONGO) store the user's venmo page settings

Fourth Part: Test the capabilities of signing into a Google Account to spit out info on to the screen

Fifth Part: Recreate Venmo UI and fit in the necessary data.
