TODO List for PVenmo:

We now have a convincing view setup for everything and need
to install our database hooks. Starting from simplest to largest
units:

Transaction
Transactions
PaymentPage

Extract the programmable portions into data that can
be inserted from a MongoDB document, where that document
can be something like:

{topbar, transactions: []}
transaction = {
    TRANSACTION FIELDS
}

Most importantly: we need a way to be able to insert new
profile images (hopefully without manual base64 conversion?).

Update as of 3/28:
Finished Upload schematics for images and getting images all available
under VenmoApp. This should be tucked away under a modal with the final
added change of being able to upload a document for the schematics of
the whole page. Also, to upload that doc/update it, we should enforce:
1. The structure is equivalent to some default structure through checking
2. There are minimums that are satisfied (min on the top bar, or #
of transactions. Each transaction will have the information of the payment
so there is no issue there.)

Ensure that documents are labeled with the credentials of the uploader.

Quick TODO:
Be able to update the config
Have default icons for the topbar
